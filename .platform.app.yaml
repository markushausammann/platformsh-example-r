# This file describes an application. You can have multiple applications
# in the same project.
#
# See https://docs.platform.sh/user_guide/reference/platform-app-yaml.html

# The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.
name: app

# The runtime the application uses.
type: "python:3.7"

# The build-time dependencies of the app.
# dependencies:
#     python3:
#        pipenv: "2018.10.13"

# The hooks executed at various points in the lifecycle of the application.
hooks:
    build: |

      # Our build hook uses `dash` rather than `bash`. dash is missing an important
      # feature that is necessary for the `conda activate` command to run, so we
      # must write the build hook in a separate script that runs with `bash`.
      #
      # NB: If a user connects to the container using `platform ssh`, they'll be
      # given a bash shell, so all commands will run normally.
      bash install_r.sh

# The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
disk: 2048
mounts:
    ".jupyter":
        source: local
        source_path: "jupyter_config"
# The relationships of the application with services or other applications.
#
# The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
# to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand
# side is in the form `<service name>:<endpoint name>`.

# The configuration of app when it is exposed to the web.
# web:
#     commands:
#         start: python server.py
